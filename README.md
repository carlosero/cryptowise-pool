# cryptowise-pool

This is a smart contract that can be used for raising funds between a pool of investors in order to submit an entire amount, let's say "50 ETH" for an ICO or private deal with a certain company. When the company delivers the tokens to our smart contract, each investor can make one single call to receive it's portion of tokens based on contribution.
Based on truffle framework for Solidity contracts.

## Setup

Clone this repo

cd into it

```shell
cd cryptowise-pool
```

Make sure everything works
```shell
npm test
```

And then you can just play with it. You can deploy contract to test net or main net if you want. This contract has not been tested on main net and should be heavily tested in test net before using it.
